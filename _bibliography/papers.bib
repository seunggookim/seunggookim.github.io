	abstract = {This article elucidates a methodological pitfall of cross-validation for evaluating predictive models applied to naturalistic neuroimaging data--namely, {\textquoteright}reverse double-dipping{\textquoteright} (RDD). In a broader context, this problem is also known as {\textquoteright}leakage in training examples{\textquoteright}, which poses challenges in detecting it in practice. This issue can occur when predictive modeling is employed with data from a conventional neuroscientific design, characterized by a limited set of stimuli repeated across trials and/or participants, resulting in spurious predictive performances due to overfitting to repeated signals, even in the presence of independent noise. Through comprehensive simulations and real-world examples following theoretical formulation, the article underscores how such information leakage can occur and how severely it could compromise the analysis when it is combined with widely spread informal reverse inference. The article concludes with practical recommendations for researchers to avoid RDD in their experiment design and analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {<p>This article discusses recent developments and advances in the neuroscience of music to understand the nature of musical emotion. In particular, it highlights how system identification techniques and computational models of music have advanced our understanding of how the human brain processes the textures and structures of music and how the processed information evokes emotions. Musical models relate physical properties of stimuli to internal representations called features, and predictive models relate features to neural or behavioral responses and test their predictions against independent unseen data. The new frameworks do not require orthogonalized stimuli in controlled experiments to establish reproducible knowledge, which has opened up a new wave of naturalistic neuroscience. The current review focuses on how this trend has transformed the domain of the neuroscience of music.</p>},

@article{zhang-kim2021jnnp,
	abstract = {Objectives Surgical procedures targeting the anterior limb of the internal capsule (aLIC) can be effective in patients with selected treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The aLIC consists of white-matter tracts connecting cortical and subcortical structures and show a topographical organisation. Here we assess how aLIC streamlines are affected in OCD compared with healthy controls (HCs) and which streamlines are related with post-capsulotomy improvement.Methods Diffusion-weighted MRI was used to compare white-matter microstructure via the aLIC between patients with OCD (n=100, 40 women, mean of age 31.8 years) and HCs (n=88, 39 women, mean of age 29.6 years). For each individual, the fractional anisotropy (FA) and streamline counts were calculated for each white-matter fibre bundle connecting a functionally defined prefrontal and subcortical region. Correlations between tractography measures and pre-capsulotomy and post-capsulotomy clinical outcomes (in obsessive-compulsive, anxiety and depression scores 6 months after surgery) were assessed in 41 patients with OCD.Results Hierarchical clustering dendrograms show an aLIC organisation clustering lateral and dissociating ventral and dorsal prefrontal{\textendash}thalamic streamlines, findings highly relevant to surgical targeting. Compared with HCs, patients with OCD had lower aLIC FA across multiple prefrontal cortical{\textendash}subcortical regions (p\&lt;0.0073, false discovery rate-adjusted). Greater streamline counts of the dorsolateral prefrontal{\textendash}thalamic tracts in patients with OCD predicted greater post-capsulotomy obsessive-compulsive improvement (p=0.016). In contrast, greater counts of the dorsal cingulate{\textendash}thalamic streamlines predicted surgical outcomes mediated by depressive and anxiety improvements.Conclusions These findings shed light on the critical role of the aLIC in OCD and may potentially contribute towards precision targeting to optimise outcomes in OCD.Data are available upon reasonable request. The MRI datasets generated and analysed during the current study are not publicly available due to privacy regulations of patient data, but are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.},

    abstract = {The likelihood of an outcome (uncertainty or sureness) and the similarity between choices (conflict or ease of a decision) are often critical to decision-making. We often ask ourselves: how likely are we to win or lose? And how different is this option’s likelihood from the other? Uncertainty is a characteristic of the stimulus and conflict between stimuli, but these dissociable processes are often confounded. Here, applying a novel hierarchical drift diffusion approach, we study their interaction using a sequential learning task in healthy volunteers and pathological groups characterized by compulsive behaviours, by posing it as an evidence accumulation problem. The variables, Conflict (difficult or easy; difference between reward probabilities of the stimuli) and Uncertainty (low, medium or high; inverse U-shaped probability-uncertainty function) were then used to extract threshold (‘a’, amount of evidence accumulated before making a decision) and drift rate (‘v’, information processing speed) parameters. Critically, when a decision was both difficult (high conflict) and uncertain, relative to other conditions, healthy volunteers unexpectedly accumulated less evidence with lower decision thresholds and accuracy rates at chance levels. In contrast, patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder had slower processing speeds during these difficult uncertain decisions; yet, despite this more cautious approach, performed suboptimally with poorer accuracy relative to healthy volunteers below that of chance level. Thus, faced with a difficult uncertain decision, healthy controls are capable of rapid possibly random decisions, displaying almost a willingness to ‘walk away’, whereas those with obsessive compulsive disorder become more deliberative and cautious but despite appearing to learn the differential contingencies, still perform poorly. These observations might underlie disordered behaviours characterized by pathological uncertainty or doubt despite compulsive checking with impaired performance. In contrast, alcohol-dependent subjects show a different pattern relative to healthy controls with difficulties in adjusting their behavioural patterns with slower drift rates or processing speed despite decisions being easy or low conflict. We emphasize the multidimensional nature of compulsive behaviours and the utility of computational models in detecting subtle underlying processes relative to behavioural measures. These observations have implications for targeted behavioural interventions for specific cognitive impairments across psychiatric disorders.},

@article{BIANCO2016454,
	abstract = {The ability to predict upcoming structured events based on long-term knowledge and contextual priors is a fundamental principle of human cognition. Tonal music triggers predictive processes based on structural properties of harmony, i.e., regularities defining the arrangement of chords into well-formed musical sequences. While the neural architecture of structure-based predictions during music perception is well described, little is known about the neural networks for analogous predictions in musical actions and how they relate to auditory perception. To fill this gap, expert pianists were presented with harmonically congruent or incongruent chord progressions, either as musical actions (photos of a hand playing chords) that they were required to watch and imitate without sound, or in an auditory format that they listened to without playing. By combining task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with functional connectivity at rest, we identified distinct sub-regions in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) interconnected with parietal and temporal areas for processing action and audio sequences, respectively. We argue that the differential contribution of parietal and temporal areas is tied to motoric and auditory long-term representations of harmonic regularities that dynamically interact with computations in rIFG. Parsing of the structural dependencies in rIFG is co-determined by both stimulus- or task-demands. In line with contemporary models of prefrontal cortex organization and dual stream models of visual-spatial and auditory processing, we show that the processing of musical harmony is a network capacity with dissociated dorsal and ventral motor and auditory circuits, which both provide the infrastructure for predictive mechanisms optimising action and perception performance.},
