I've created
a MATLAB package
called [LEAðŸ‘§](https://github.com/seunggookim/lea)
, which stands for Linearized Encoding Analysis.
This was developed for my tutorial lecture at [KSMPC-SS24](https://github.com/seunggookim/ksmpc-ss24-sess3).

While its functionality is limited, still one can use for most of behavioural and physiological time series data.
Let me know if you're interested in using this for your research. I am willing to further develop this for collaboration.
