First, surface-based analysis is cool because the cerebral cortex 🧠 looks like a 2-D curved manifold, of which functional organization seems to be gorverned by geodesic proximity. So, a surface-based analysis is attracitve, also for linearized encoding analysis! 👧❤️🏄‍♀️

However, there are some things that make surface-based analysis more difficult than volume-based analysis.

Let's start with a file format. There are standard file formats for neuroimaging data like NIfTI ([Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/)) and GIfTI ([geometry format under the NIfTI](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gifti/)). This allows read and write triangular meshes across languages easily.

But all triangular meshs can have very different topologies.

Since late 90s, multiple cortical surface templates have been proposed and used. Let me list a few:
