## Why Does Music Move Us—and What Happens in the Brain When We Listen to It?: Multi-Session MRI and EEG Study on Musical Emotions

We, researchers at [the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://ae.mpg.de/en), are investigating these questions in a long-term scientific study. Our team led by [Dr. Seung-Goo Kim](https://seunggookim.github.io/) are looking for music enthusiasts who are willing to help us better understand the interplay between music, emotions, and brain activity 🎵🧠😢🙂.
 
As part of the study, **you will participate in 34 music listening sessions, which will take place over the course of a year at our research facilities in Frankfurt am Main**. During each session, state-of-the-art technology (MRI or EEG) will record your brain activity. Each session lasts around two to three hours.
 
You will receive a total expense allowance of **€2,500.00** for your participation, which will be paid out proportionally after each session.
 
### ✅ Participation requirements: 

We are looking for participants who are

- Between 18 and 35 years old;
- Living in or around Frankfurt am Main for the duration of the study (approx. 1 year from Oct 2025);
- Able to participate in a total of 34 MRI or EEG sessions (weekly with possible breaks);
 
You should also have

- No neurological or psychiatric disorders (past or present);
- No metallic objects or materials on or in the body;
- No other contraindications for MRI.
