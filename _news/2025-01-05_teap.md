I will be attending a German conference for experimental psychologists ([Tagung experimentell arbeitender Psycholog:innen \[TeaP2025\]](https://coms.app/TeaP2025/welcome.html)) from 9 to 12 March 2025, at Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main.
Presentations can be either in English or German.
I am going to present a talk about the neural encoding of musical emotions, and a technical poster about conference programming based on a large-language model.
The event is free for BSc, MSc students at Goethe University!
