I and my colleagues at the MPIEA invite you to a hybrid event, [Open Science Workshop](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/the-institute/events/events/article/open-science-workshop-en.html) on 26 November 2024, 14:00-17:00 CET,
where we discuss practical ideas and measures to promote the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of scientific research.
