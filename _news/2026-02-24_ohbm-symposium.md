Spearheaded by [Dr. Sarah Faber](https://www.sfu.ca/postdoctoral-fellows/profiles/Sarah-Faber.html), our symposium proposal has been accepted for the [2026 OHBM Annual Meeting](https://humanbrainmapping.org/)! The symposium will be held on June 2026, and the title is **"Sound and Music: Naturalistic Approaches to Auditory–Motor and Affective Brain Dynamics"**. We are looking forward to meeting you in Bordeaux, France! 🇫🇷🍷
