Spearheaded by Dr. Sarah Faber, our symposium proposal has been accepted for the 2026 OHBM Annual Meeting! The symposium will be held on June 14, 2026, and the title is **"Sound and Music: Naturalistic Approaches to Auditory–Motor and Affective Brain Dynamics"**. We are looking forward to meeting you in Bordeaux, France! 🇫🇷🍷
