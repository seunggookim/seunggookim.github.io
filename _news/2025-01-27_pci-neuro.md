As of 26 January 2025, I have joined the Peer Community In Neuroscience ([PCI-neuro](https://neuro.peercommunityin.org/)) as a Recommender, which functions similarly to a handling editor in conventional journals. The “Peer Community In” ([PCI](https://peercommunityin.org)) is a not-for-profit and non-commercial organization that publishes peer reviews in open access at no cost. Once a preprint is recommended by a Recommender based on the reviews, authors can choose to send it to PCI-friendly journals for expedited processing. It would attract more authors with more journals that do not require additional reviews with a recommendation. Let’s see how this radical movement (by scientists, for scientists!🧪) unfolds. The Max Planck Society is one of the supporting societies.
