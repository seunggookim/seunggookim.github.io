This three-hour tutorial was given as a part of [the Korean Society for Music Perception and Cognition Summer School](https://www.ksmpc.kr/single-post/2024-%EC%A0%9C-3-%ED%9A%8C-%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%9D%8C%EC%95%85%EC%A7%80%EA%B0%81%EC%9D%B8%EC%A7%80%ED%95%99%ED%9A%8C-%EC%97%AC%EB%A6%84%ED%95%99%EA%B5%90).
All materials (presentation slides, hands-on MATLAB LiveScripts) can be found in [my public GitHub repository](https://github.com/seunggookim/ksmpc-ss24-sess3).

This course was taught via Zoom as I was in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and attendees were in Seoul, South Korea.
Here are a few practicals for my own future reference:

- Apple Keynote now supports the window-presentation mode. This can be activated from [Play]>[In Window].
- To switch between Keynote and MATLAB, sharing a part of the screen can be useful since sharing the full screen makes things really slow. This option can be found at [Share]>[Advanced]>[Portion of Screen].
- In a hybrid meeting, attendees may not have access to Zoom chat. Per a brilliant KAIST student Hyun-Jae Kim's recommendation, I used [Padlet](https://padlet.com) for an open bulletin board to communicate with the attendees, which worked superbly well!
  This service is for now (2024-09-14) free for 3 boards.
