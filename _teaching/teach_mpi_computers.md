Working as a research scientist at an interdisciplinary research institute means that your colleagues often have widely different backgrounds than you.

In this day and age, almost everyone has at least one computer-like device (I mean your mobile phone). However, doing scientific research with digital data requires some nerdy skillsðŸ¤“, which sometimes scares off normal peopleðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨.

To help colleagues and friends in our group and at our institute, I have prepared some light-hearted presentations to cover a few tricks (the list is growing):

- [2024-08-07, Data/code management.gitâ€”How do I use Git?](2024-08-07_LabmeetingNCML_git_Kim.pdf)
- [2024-08-21, How do I edit a file in a Terminal? ðŸ¤·](2024-08-21_LabmeetingNCML_cli_Kim.pdf)

## Resources

- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/): This is a very cool series of lectures from MIT for new students majoring in Computer Science. I don't think all music researchers need to know everything here (while definitely useful). I have taken lots of inspiration from this.
- [A lecture on Scientific Computing Languages](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Lecture_HPC_5_Scientific_Computing_Languages.pdf): for economists using high-performance computing for their research, Dr. JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde, Department of Economics, University of Pennsylvania, introduces general-purpose languages (GPL) and domain-specific languages (DSL) for scientific computation: Python is a good GPL. But eventually you "want" to learn C++. R is a good DSL. Matlab still remains relevant. Julia is promising but still very young.
