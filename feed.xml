So, a surface-based analysis is attractive, also for linearized encoding analysis! üëß‚ù§Ô∏èüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p> <p>However, there are some things that make surface-based analysis more difficult than volume-based analysis.</p> <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Which information do we need to define a surface? And which information do we need to define a volume?</p> <h3 id="volume">Volume</h3> <p>A digital 3-D image (i.e., a volume) is a tensor (or an 3-D array). For example, say we have a 3-D image with 2 rows, 3 columns, and 2 pages like:</p> \[\mathbf{I} \in \mathbb{N}^{2 \times 3 \times 2} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ d &amp; e &amp; f \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} g &amp; h &amp; i \\ j &amp; k &amp; l \end{bmatrix} \end{array} \right]\] <p>This image itself does not have any location information in it, but we organize them so that it preserves relative spatial information. That is, the value $b$ itself doesn‚Äôt say anything about its location $(1,2,1)$ but we know that $b$ is one column after $a$ and one page before $h$ from the arrangement of the 3-D array. Such relative information may be sufficient in many applications. But in neuroimaging, and medical imaging in general, it is very important to precisely know how the voxel $(1,2,1)$ corresponds to a real-world coordinate (i.e., is it $(1, 2, 1) \mathrm{mm}$ or $(10,-200,0.1) \mathrm{cm}$?). And this is defined by the orders and directions of axes, as well as the sampling spacing (or voxel dimensions).</p> <p>Why should we consider different orientations of axes? Because we are looking at a matrix as shown above, we may think it would be <strong>natural</strong> to map LEFT-to-RIGHT along the columns and UP-to-DOWN along the rows (i.e., ‚ÄúDown‚Äù for the first dimension; ‚ÄúRight‚Äù for the second dimension; can be written as ‚ÄúDR‚Äù). However, if we think about a Cartesian plane, we may think that the first coordinate (row) should increase along the LEFT-to-RIGHT direction an the second coordinate (column) should increase along the DOWN-to-UP direction (i.e., ‚ÄúRU‚Äù) There are different conventions for the orientations of axes, and all conventions are valid. Often, these are written as a three-character string, representing a direction that increases a coordinate of each dimension in Left, Right, Anterior, Posterior, Superior, Inferior. For example, LAS in radiology; RAS in neurology; RSA or RSP in 3D computer graphics. Of course, are we talking about the viewer‚Äôs left or the subject‚Äôs left? It all makes sense in one way.</p> <p>One simple yet inefficient way to solve this is to save a list of coordinates together with the value map like:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Voxel</th> <th>World (mm)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>(1, 1, 1)</td> <td>(-0.5, -3, 0.5)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(1, 2, 1)</td> <td>(-0.5, -2, 0.5)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>:</td> <td>:</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>This list will grow as we have more voxels. A conventional anatomical image contains 4M+ voxels and a functional image has 300K+ voxels. Moreover, this pair of coordinates can be even larger than the scalar value we need to save. Not a very good ideaüòï.</p> <p>A lot more elegant and efficient way is to save a transformation matrix (4-by-4 matrix with 4 elements are always the same) with the scalar map and calculate the world coordinate of a certain voxel on the fly when asked. This is a lot easier to do because the transformation of a voxel-based coordinate to a world-based coordinate is a very simple ([4x4] x [4x1]) matrix multiplication.</p> <p>So, for a volume data, we need to know the voxel-to-world transformation matrix. In neuroimaging community, a standard format called NIfTI (<a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/">Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative</a>) has been used since 2004. More general 3D computer graphics community uses formats such as VTK (<a href="https://vtk.org">Visualization Toolkit</a>) and ITK (<a href="https://itk.org">Insight Toolkit</a>).</p> <h3 id="3-d-triangle-mesh">3-D triangle mesh</h3> <p>What about 3-D surfaces? A continuous surface is triangulated to represent it as a <strong>triangle mesh</strong>, which is a set of tiny triangles stitched together like this donut:</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><img alt="torus" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Torus-triang.png/1635px-Torus-triang.png" width="400px" data-zoomable=""/></td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Fig 1. A triangulated torus</em> (CC-BY-SA-3.0: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=30856793">Ag2gaeh</a>)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>To store this donut, we need a bit more tables. First, locations of vertices:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>VertexID</th> <th>World (mm)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>(-0.5, -3.0, 0.5)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>(-0.5, -2.5, 0.5)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>:</td> <td>:</td> </tr> <tr> <td>V</td> <td>(3.1, -6.0, -2.0)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Second, an ordered list of vertices describing how each face is constructed:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>FaceID</th> <th>VertexIDs</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>(1, 6, 3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>(3, 10, 6)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>:</td> <td>:</td> </tr> <tr> <td>F</td> <td>(45, 21, 55)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Finally, we want to store a large vector describing a scalar-map over vertices:</p> \[\mathbf{I} \in \mathbb{N}^{V} = [a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_V ]\] <p>How do we save all this information in a binary format consistently across computing languages? Luckily, since 2007, GIfTI (<a href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gifti/">geometry format under the NIfTI</a>) has been used as a standard format to read and write triangle mesh and vertex-mapped scalar data. So what‚Äôs the problem? ü§∑</p> <h2 id="inconsistent-topologies">Inconsistent topologies</h2> <p>But all triangular meshes can have very different topologies.</p> <p>Since late 90s, multiple cortical surface templates have been proposed and used.
