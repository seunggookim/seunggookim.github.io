The problem is: some postdocs want to teach some topics, some PhD students want to learn other topics, and not everyone can come to the session every month.</p> <p>What normal people normally would do is just ask around who can teach what, and then make a schedule based on the instructors. But then it’s possible that some sessions have no participants (sad instructors😢) and some participants miss their interested sessions (sad participants😢).</p> <p>In the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-engineering">over-engineering</a>, I have developed a Grossly Over-Optimising<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (GOO) algorithm to solve this problem. The algorithm is designed to maximise the utilitarian utility of a community (i.e., the sum of the utilities of all individuals).</p> <h2 id="0-definition">0. Definition</h2> <p>Basic units are defined as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>Session</em>: a specified time and place to teach and learn a topic.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Topic</em>: a subject for the session.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Instructor</em>: a person who teaches the topic.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Participant</em>: a person who learns the topic.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Let’s say we have multiple rectangular binary matrices that code:</p> <ul> <li> <p>which instructor wants to teach which topic:   $\mathbf{T}$ &lt;#Instructors x #Topics&gt;</p> </li> <li> <p>which instructor can come in which month: $\mathbf{N}$ &lt;#Instructors x #Topics&gt;</p> </li> <li> <p>which participant wants to learn which topic: $\mathbf{L}$ &lt;#Participants x #Topics&gt;</p> </li> <li> <p>which participant can come in which month: $\mathbf{P}$ &lt;#Participants x #Topics&gt;</p> </li> </ul> <p>For simplicity, we discarded topics without any instructors.</p> <h3 id="01-utility-function">0.1. Utility function</h3> <p>The aggregated utility of all participants is defined as the sum of the number of participants over all months.</p> <p>Say we have a rectangular matrix: $\mathbf{Z}$ &lt;#Months x #Topics&gt; with the number of interested participants who are able to come as its elements. Then the utility is defined as:</p> \[U = ζ(\mathbf{Z}) =  Σ_{i,j} z(i,j)\] <p>in a unit of <em>“a person’s happiness”</em>. Based on the utilitarian view, every individual has an equal contribution to the community-level utility.</p> <h3 id="02-future-discount">0.2. Future discount</h3> <p>Classically, (British) economists have argued that it is not a sin for banks to take interest (for loans that funded piracy/colonial business) by theorising “future discount”.💰 While its historical application is morally ambiguous, the notion that “future uncertainty should be addressed”💸 may still be valid even for our cause, simply because we have less information about events in the distant future. 🔮 (That is, it may be reasonable to think that a marshmallow promised in 15 minutes is not really 1 marshmallow but 0.9 marshmallows, because that mean psychologist might eat up everything in the meantime!; See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment</a>)</p> <p>The discount rate is based on the Bundesbank basic rate of interest as of 2026-01-01 (<a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/en/bundesbank/organisation/gtc-and-legal-basis/basic-rate-of-interest-616708">LINK</a>): 1.27% per annum, which is 0.1058% per mensem.</p> <p>The weight for the m-th month is $w(m) = (1 - \lambda)^{m-1}$ where $\lambda$ is the discount per mensem (here, $\lambda=0.1058/100$). Then the discounted utility is defined as:</p> \[U = ζ(\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{w}) =  Σ_{i,j} z(i,j).w(i)\] <h3 id="03-solution">0.3. Solution</h3> <p>Now we need to figure out who will teach what when, while maximising the sum of happiness of individual members (very utilitarian).</p> <p>Our decisions on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;when&gt;</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;who&gt;</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;what&gt;</code> can be coded in two rectangular binary matrices as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>which month will host which topic:  $\mathbf{S}$ &lt;#Months x #Topics&gt;</p> </li> <li> <p>which instructor will teach which topic: $\mathbf{A}$ &lt;#Instructors x #Topics&gt; </p> </li> </ul> <p>The Session matrix S has a policy-wise constraint:</p> <ul> <li>The sum of each column ≤ 1 (one month can host only one topic).</li> </ul> <p>The Assignment matrix A has the following constraints:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The sum of each column ≤ 1 (one topic is taught by only one instructor).</p> </li> <li> <p>$a(i,j) ≤ t(i,j)$ (an instructor can only teach a topic if they want to teach it).</p> </li> </ul> <p>These rules were enforced when generating random solutions, so the optimiser only needs to evaluate the utility of legal solutions.</p> <h2 id="1-evaluation">1. Evaluation</h2> <p>With the given S and A, we can compute Z as:</p> \[\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{X} ⊙ \mathbf{Y}\] <p>where $\mathbf{X}$ &lt;#Months x #Topics&gt; is the possible teaching matrix (combining interest, availability, and assignment):</p> <p>\(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{N}'(\mathbf{T} ⊙ \mathbf{A}) \)   and $\mathbf{Y}$ &lt;#Months x #Topics&gt; is the possible participation matrix (combining interest, availability, and assignment):</p> \[\mathbf{Y} = (\mathbf{P}'\mathbf{L}) ⊙ \mathbf{S}\] <p>Here, $⊙$ denotes the element-wise (Hadamard) product, and the prime ($’$) denotes matrix transposition.</p> <p>That is, the utility can be expanded as:</p> \[U = ζ[ {N'(T ⊙ A)} ⊙ {(P'L) ⊙ S}, w ]\] <h2 id="2-optimisation">2. Optimisation</h2> <p>The universal optimiser (i.e., “try-many-random-legal-solutions-and-find-the-best-one”) is used. To ensure reproducibility and avoid storing the entire matrices, a sequence of natural numbers was used as seed values. A reasonable search could have stopped at around 100,000 iterations (3.332 seconds). But GOO is committed to the over-optimisation and was willing to sample more than the total number of possible combinations. So, the search was extended to 10,000,000 iterations (333.550 seconds). “The solution was identical to that with 100,000 iterations and a complete waste of time (nice!).” could have been hilarious, but it turns out that we need this many iterations for this brute-force approach. 🤷</p> <h2 id="3-implementation">3.

So, a surface-based analysis is attractive, also for linearized encoding analysis! 👧❤️🏄‍♀️</p> <p>However, there are some things that make surface-based analysis more difficult than volume-based analysis.</p> <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Which information do we need to define a surface? And which information do we need to define a volume?</p> <h3 id="volume">Volume</h3> <p>A digital 3-D image (i.e., a volume) is a tensor (or an 3-D array). For example, say we have a 3-D image with 2 rows, 3 columns, and 2 pages like:</p> \[\mathbf{I} \in \mathbb{N}^{2 \times 3 \times 2} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ d &amp; e &amp; f \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} g &amp; h &amp; i \\ j &amp; k &amp; l \end{bmatrix} \end{array} \right]\] <p>This image itself does not have any location information in it, but we organize them so that it preserves relative spatial information. That is, the value $b$ itself doesn’t say anything about its location $(1,2,1)$ but we know that $b$ is one column after $a$ and one page before $h$ from the arrangement of the 3-D array. Such relative information may be sufficient in many applications. But in neuroimaging, and medical imaging in general, it is very important to precisely know how the voxel $(1,2,1)$ corresponds to a real-world coordinate (i.e., is it $(1, 2, 1) \mathrm{mm}$ or $(10,-200,0.1) \mathrm{cm}$?). And this is defined by the orders and directions of axes, as well as the sampling spacing (or voxel dimensions).</p> <p>Why should we consider different orientations of axes? Because we are looking at a matrix as shown above, we may think it would be <strong>natural</strong> to map LEFT-to-RIGHT along the columns and UP-to-DOWN along the rows (i.e., “Down” for the first dimension; “Right” for the second dimension; can be written as “DR”). However, if we think about a Cartesian plane, we may think that the first coordinate (row) should increase along the LEFT-to-RIGHT direction an the second coordinate (column) should increase along the DOWN-to-UP direction (i.e., “RU”) There are different conventions for the orientations of axes, and all conventions are valid. Often, these are written as a three-character string, representing a direction that increases a coordinate of each dimension in Left, Right, Anterior, Posterior, Superior, Inferior. For example, LAS in radiology; RAS in neurology; RSA or RSP in 3D computer graphics. Of course, are we talking about the viewer’s left or the subject’s left? It all makes sense in one way.</p> <p>One simple yet inefficient way to solve this is to save a list of coordinates together with the value map like:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Voxel</th> <th>World (mm)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>(1, 1, 1)</td> <td>(-0.5, -3, 0.5)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(1, 2, 1)</td> <td>(-0.5, -2, 0.5)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>:</td> <td>:</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>This list will grow as we have more voxels. A conventional anatomical image contains 4M+ voxels and a functional image has 300K+ voxels. Moreover, this pair of coordinates can be even larger than the scalar value we need to save. Not a very good idea😕.</p> <p>A lot more elegant and efficient way is to formulate this problem as an affine transformation (because it is!):</p> \[\begin{bmatrix} x_w \\ y_w \\ z_w \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; t_x \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; t_y \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} &amp; t_z \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_v \\ y_v \\ z_v \\ 1 \end{bmatrix},\] <p>where $\begin{bmatrix}x_w &amp; y_w &amp; z_w\end{bmatrix}^\mathrm{T}$ denote a 3-D world coordinate, $\begin{bmatrix}x_v &amp; y_v &amp; z_v\end{bmatrix}^\mathrm{T}$ denotes a 3-D voxel coordinate, $(a_{ij})$ are rotation and scaling components, and $\begin{bmatrix}t_x &amp; t_y &amp; t_z\end{bmatrix}^\mathrm{T}$ are translation components.</p> <p>In this way, we only need to save 12 elements in the transformation matrix (the 4 in the last row are always the same), and calculate the world coordinate of a certain voxel on the fly when asked by computing a small matrix-vector multiplication. The same 12 numbers will generate an accurate world coordinate for every voxel in the volume! (We never have to store a list of coordinate mapping for 4M+ voxels!😝)</p> <p>So, for a volume data, we need to know the voxel-to-world transformation matrix. The world-to-voxel transformation matrix can be easily found by inverting the 4-by-4 matrix (takes about 4.8 msec), which can be costly if you also repeat this for 4M+ times (like 5+ hours). So, it makes more sense to just store another set of 12 numbers. In neuroimaging community, a standard format called NIfTI (<a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/">Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative</a>) has been used since 2004. Only after many years, MALTAB included read/write functions in its Image Processing Toolbox since R2017b.</p> <ul id="surf2" class="tab" data-tab="385e8121-7563-47cd-9a97-5268e6a15e3f" data-name="surf2"> <li class="active" id="surf2-matlab"> <a href="#">matlab </a> </li> </ul> <ul class="tab-content" id="385e8121-7563-47cd-9a97-5268e6a15e3f" data-name="surf2"> <li class="active"> <div class="language-matlab highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">Info</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">niftiinfo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'MNI152_T1_2mm.nii.gz'</span><span class="p">)</span>

A continuous surface is triangulated to represent it as a <strong>triangle mesh</strong>, which is a set of tiny triangles stitched together like this donut:</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><img alt="torus" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Torus-triang.png/1635px-Torus-triang.png" width="400px" data-zoomable=""/></td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Fig 1.

Luckily, since 2007, GIfTI (<a href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gifti/">geometry format under the NIfTI</a>) has been used as a standard format to read and write triangle mesh and vertex-mapped scalar data.

But the underlying triangulation can drastically vary across data, making surface-based registration difficult.</p> <h2 id="spherical-registration">Spherical registration</h2> <p>The cortical surface of a hemisphere is often modelled as a closed surface. If you ignore the corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and hippocampus, the cerebral cortex can be seen as a sphere with a hole. If we just sagittally cut the corpus callosum and wrap around the medial structures, you now have a closed surface, topologically homologous to a sphere!</p> <p>You may ask:</p> <blockquote> <p>🤨: “But why do you want to cut two hemispheres 🧠 into two icosahedrons? ⚽️⚽️”</p> </blockquote> <p>Why not? 🤓 Wouldn’t it be so nice if all cortical surfaces have the identical Euler characteristic of $\chi=2$? 🥹 Without holes, without intersecting edges or faces, without non-differentiable spikes, just like a perfect just like a perfect sphere!🤩 Also, wouldn’t it be so nice if all those tiny triangles📐 are well-ordered😇 (i.e., the vertices are listed in an outward-counter-clock-wise order along the columns in the face list so that the cross-product of v1v2 and v1v3 would be the outward face-normal) and regular in size? 🤗</p> <p>Besides the true joy, there are practical reasons why a spherical modeling is something to consider.</p> <p>[to be continued…]</p> <h2 id="incompatible-software">Incompatible software</h2> <p>Since late 90s, multiple cortical surface templates have been proposed and used.

This script worked fine on the local computer, but it doesn’t build and deploy the website on the remote🙃. So I learned more about how to find error messages from the deployment process built in the workflows; and learned that all JSON files in the directory should be valid.
